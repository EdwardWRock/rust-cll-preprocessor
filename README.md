He believes in a world where innovation may not be a bad thing, but some areas need to be reevaluated, too.

"It's hard to see more of a shift from a sustainable growth trajectory. There's too much of a fear among the business community about how to innovate," he said. "It's hard to see how anyone can continue to build, without making investments that are beneficial for business and their customers. So if any of the existing sectors do well with business growth, I think that change is going to happen in both the long term."

He thinks more and more companies are going to see the need to be strategic in changing their business environments and investing in innovation to address these issues.

"I've talked to a lot of top executives who say the biggest question is how do you get to where the business is going to be and how, if at all, do you build this business and grow it effectively so the investment flows are there to ensure there's sustainability and economic growth?" he added. "They're looking to change that. You're not going to build a business out of the ground."
